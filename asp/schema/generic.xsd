    Generic XSD template file.

    A XSD file named the same as the SQL file is required in schema/Generic folder
    in order for the query to be executed via the custom Volusion Generic API call.

    For example:

    schema/Generic/BoltPaymentMethod.sql - SQL file
    schema/Generic/BoltPaymentMethod.xsd - XSD schema file

    Two temporary files are generated in schema/Generic folder every time a custom query
    needs to be executed, SQL and XSL file, with the same name and different extensions.

    Then the API is called with that name as a generic API name like this

    <volusionApiUrl>?<credentials>&API_Name=Generic\<generated file name>

    After the result XML is stored, the generated files are deleted.

    This file, generic.xsd, is used as a XSD schema file for every query,
    temporaary copied to schema/Generic under appropriate, random-generated name.
